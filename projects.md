## Procedural Tile Map Generation

This project was both challenging and rewarding, as it combined my interest in data manipulation with a tangible, visual outcome. I particularly enjoyed transforming simple text file characters into a visually appealing result. Early on, I struggled with determining when to write to a file versus when to store data in a multi-dimensional array for further use. Initially, I based most of my implementation directly on the text file, which limited efficiency and flexibility. This experience deepened my understanding of File I/O in C#, and ultimately, I opted to rewrite my codebase to better align with the project's goals and deliverables.

## SQLite Database Parsing

I’ve found working with databases to be both fascinating and rewarding. As someone who values neatness and organization, creating and managing an SQLite database has been not only an educational experience but also surprisingly therapeutic. This project has also opened my eyes to the many real-world applications where a database of this scale—or slightly larger—could be incredibly valuable.
