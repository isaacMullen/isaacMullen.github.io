## Procedural Tile Map Generation

This project was super rewarding. I enjoy maniupulating data to make it do something for me, bonus points if I can see the result; learning how to turn simple characters from a text file into something that has some visual appeal was right up my alley. I struggled getting a solid grasp on when to write to a file and when I didn't have to, in the beginning I was doing most everything based on the text file itself and choosing not to store it's data it a multi-dimensional array for further use. This led me to understand File I/O in C# on a deeper level, however I ultimately decided to rewrite my codebase so it could satisfy the outcomes of the project.

## SQLite Database Parsing

Databases are quite cool, I love when things are neat and organized so being able create and sort this SQLite database hasn't only been a learning experience it's also been therapeutic is a way. I'm also starting to see the numerous scenarios in the real world that a database of similar scale to, if not a bit larger than, this one could prove extremely useful.
